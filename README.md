# Domain Angular SPA

This project is a re-write of [domain-react-spa](https://github.com/scottabutler/domain-react-spa/) in Angular v17.

A demo is [available here](https://jonathont.github.io/domain-angular-spa).

Note that static test data will be used if no Domain API key is provided via a `?api_key=xxx` query parameter. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
